kit - concatenate and copy files


USAGE:

kit [-o outfile] infile1 [...infile2....]
kit [-o outfile]
    
DESCRIPTION:

This program opens each of the named input files in order, and concatenates
the entire contents of each file, in order, to the output. If an
outfile is specified, kit opens that file (once) for writing, creating it
if it did not already exist, and overwriting the contents if it did.
If no outfile is specified, the output is written to standard output, which
is assumed to already be open.
During the concatenation, kit will use a read/write buffer size of 4096 bytes.

Any of the infiles can be the special name - (a single hyphen). kit
will then concatenate standard input to the output, reading until end-of-file,
but will not attempt to re-open nor to close standard input. The hyphen can be
specified multiple times in the argument list, each of which will cause
standard input to be read again at that point.

If no infiles are specified, kit reads from standard input until eof.

EXIT STATUS:

program returns 0 if no errors (opening, reading, writing or closing)
were encountered.

Otherwise, it terminates immediately upon the error, giving a proper
error report, and returns -1.

EXAMPLES:

kit file1 - file2
(read from file1 until EOF, then standard input until EOF, then file2,
output to standard output)

kit -o output - - file3
(read from standard input until EOF, then read again from standard input
until EOF, then read file3 until EOF, all output to file "output")
